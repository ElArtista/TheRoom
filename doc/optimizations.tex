\section{Optimizations}

\subsection{File Loading}
When loading a data resource, the biggest bottleneck is in the fetch from a persistent storage medium.
Doing multiple IO operations on a hard disk for example, can heavily increase the load time of a file
due to their mix with other IO operations from the rest of the Operating System\footnote{Programs do
not have exclusive ownership of the hard disk in a multitasking environment}. With this in mind, resources
from Hard Drive or other persistent storages are best loaded with the fewest IO operations that can be done.
In our case, files are being read in a single shot.

\subsection{Rendering State Changes Minimization}
Changing often the driver state (through OpenGL calls for example), can also steal precious time from the program.
This occurs because a possible driver call may change the state in our graphics card hardware or not depending
on the action we took.\footnote{Although, modern drivers often try to defer as much state change as possible
till the next draw call} Therefore, redundant graphics API calls are avoided and similar ones are batched
as much as possible.
