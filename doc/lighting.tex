\section{Lighting}
\subsection{Preface}
One of the most important factors that make a scene realistic is how the light interacts with the objects in it.
Through the time rendering techniques progressed from various empirical models (e.g. Phong models), that required
tweaking from the artists in order to make results seem more real under different lighting setups, to physical based
algorithms (e.g. Microfacet models) that calculate the correct object lighting given the lighting environment and
its material properties. The Physical Based models are based around the laws of physics on how light interacts with
matter depending on a number of environmental variables.

\subsection{Background}
All the physical based rendering models try to solve a simplified version of the rendering equation \cite{lighting:ref32}.
This equation is a function which gives the outgoing light in a particular direction $\omega_o$ from a point $p$ on a surface
and looks like this:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rendeq}
L_o(p,\omega_o) = L_e(p, \omega_o) + \int_\Omega f_r(p,\omega_i,\omega_o)L_i(p,\omega_i)n\cdot\omega_i \ d\omega_i
\end{equation}

Breaking down the equation we get:

\begin{equation}
\underbrace{L_o(p,\omega_o)}_\text{Outgoing Light} = \underbrace{L_e(p, \omega_o)}_\text{Emitted Light} + \underbrace{\int_\Omega f_r(p,\omega_i,\omega_o)L_i(p,\omega_i)n\cdot\omega_i \ d\omega_i}_\text{Integral}
\end{equation}

According to the equation the \textit{outgoing light} in a particular direction from a point on a surface is the sum of the
sum of the \textit{emitted light} from that point and the sum of all the incoming light from all directions in a hemisphere
above the point p (the orientation of the hemisphere is determined by the normal n).

Breaking down the integral we get:
\begin{equation}
\int_\Omega \underbrace{f_r(p,\omega_i,\omega_o)}_\text{BRDF}\underbrace{L_i(p,\omega_i)}_\text{Incoming Light}\underbrace{n\cdot\omega_i}_\text{Normal Attenuation}\ d\omega_i
\end{equation}

Where BRDF is a function returning the ratio of the amount of light reflected in a particular direction $\omega_o$, to the
amount received from another direction $\omega_i$ (more details later), incoming light is the light arriving at the point p
from the direction $\omega_i$, and the normal attenuation is an attenuation factor that makes the incoming light at $p$
dependent on the cosine of the angle between the normal $n$ and the incoming light direction $\omega_i$. Note that the
incoming light doesn't have to come from a light source (direct light), it may have been reflected or refracted from another
point int the scene (indirect light).
